Fix_str.py is the script that gets rid of the problematic extra columns in pandas.

Duffy_QC.R creates a distance matrix (D). I'm hoping to eventually have code that will index the matrix (when given an individual it will give the 5 most closely related individuals.)
The .str file is too big to attach (they allow 25 MB and it is 29 MB). However, I can attach a subset of the data for reference if needed.
