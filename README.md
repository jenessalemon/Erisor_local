Fix_str.py is the script that gets rid of the problematic extra columns in pandas.

Duffy_QC.R creates a distance matrix (D). I'm hoping to eventually have code that will index the matrix (when given an individual it will give the 5 most closely related individuals.)
The .str file is too big to attach (they allow 25 MB and it is 29 MB) but that is probably good because you would be bored and solve this in like 3 minutes if you had the data. However, if anyone wants me to I can attach a subset of the data for reference.
